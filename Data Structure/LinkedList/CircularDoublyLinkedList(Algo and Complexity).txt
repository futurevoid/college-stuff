Complexities:
Add_at_front: O(1) Constant
Add_at_any_index: O(n) Linear
Add_at_the_end: O(1) Constant
Delete: O(n) Linear
Search: O(n) Linear
The overall complexity is ranging from O(1) to O(n)

Algorithms:

Add at Front:

    Create a new node with the provided data.
    If list is empty
        set the new node as both the head and the tail to make it circular.
    else
         update pointers accordingly and set the new node as the new head.
    End if

Add at Any Index:

Check if the previous node exists.
Create a new node with the provided data.
    If previous node is last node
        set the next of the previous node to the new node.
    else
         update pointers accordingly to insert the new node after the specified node.
    End if

Add at the End:

Create a new node with the provided data.
    If list is empty
        set the new node as both the head and the tail to make it circular.
    else
        Traverse the list to find the last node.
        update pointers accordingly and set the new node as the new tail to make it circular    
    End if

Delete:

Start from the head node.
    If head node contains the key
        update the head and delete the previous head.
    else
         Traverse the list to find the node with the given key.
         Update pointers to remove the node with the key.
    End if

Search:

Start from the head node.
Traverse the list and search for the specified element.
Print a message if the element is found or if it doesn't exist in the list.

Print List:

Start from the head node.
Traverse the list and print each node's data.
Exit the loop when the traversal reaches the initial head node, indicating the completion of one full traversal of the circular list.
