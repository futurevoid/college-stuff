Arithmetic calculation : O(1)
Geometric calculation : O(1)

ALGO:
Prompt the user to choose between an arithmetic and geometric sequence.

Take user input for the necessary parameters based on the chosen sequence type (first term, common difference/ratio, and the number of terms).

If the user chooses an arithmetic sequence:
Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence to calculate the sum.

If the user chooses a geometric sequence:
Use the formula for the sum of a geometric sequence to calculate the sum.

Print the calculated sum of the sequence.
