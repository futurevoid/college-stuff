An HDD uses magnetism, which allows you to store data on a rotating platter.<br>
It has a read/write head that floats above the spinning platter for Reading and Writing of the data.<br>
The faster the platter spins, the quicker an HDD can perform.<br>
HDD also consists of an I/O controller and firmware, which tells the hardware what to do and communicates with the remaining system.<br>
The full form of HDD is Hard Disk Drive.</p>

Solid State Drive (SSD) is a non-volatile storage device that stores and retrieves data constantly on solid-state flash memory.<br>
However, this data is stored on interconnected flash memory chips instead of platters, which makes them faster than HDDs.<br>
It provides better performance compared to HDD.</p>
