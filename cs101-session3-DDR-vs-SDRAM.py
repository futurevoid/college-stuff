First on the scene of this stack of acronyms was Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM), introduced in the 1970s. 
DRAM is not regulated by a clock. DRAM is asynchronous, i.e., not synchronized by any external influence. 
This posed a problem in organizing data as it comes in so it can be queued for the process it’s associated with. 
Because DRAM was asynchronous, it was not going to work as fast with processors that were just getting faster.""",unsafe_allow_html=True)
